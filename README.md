<b>MANAGANA</b>

Managana is a free cross-platform software for digital publication based on imagination as interface. Created by the Ciclope atelier, it allows the creation and maintenance of communities that share interactive content on the web, tablets, smartphones and exhibits. Each community has interactive streams composed of clusters of audiovisual, graphics, text and external feeds. Managana mixes and sequences playlists that can be created, displayed, and animated in the software itself.

<br /><b>CICLOPE AS3 CLASSES</b>

This repository comes with Actionscript3 classes developed by the Ciclope Atelier (www.ciclope.com.br) for media handling, mainly for the Managana (www.managana.org) development.

<br /><b>LICENSE</b>

Managana is licensed under the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html" target="_blank">LGPL v3</a> terms.

<br /><b>CODE</b>

Managana source code is split among its various modules. All the related repositories contain a FlashDevelop (www.flashdevelop.org) project ready to be build. Managana uses the Apache Flex SDK (flex.apache.org) instead of the Adobe one.

To build any Managana project you'll need to add the Ciclope AS3 classes (https://github.com/lujunq/ciclopeas3) to your classpath. You'll also need other free third party libraries listed at the "about extensions and libraries.txt" text.
